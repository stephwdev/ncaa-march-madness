# ncaa-march-madness
Database project using NCAA March Madness Data

This project was completed in a team with 2 other members, Toya Okeke and Chelsea Johnson

We were tasked with creating a relational database, which we chose SQLite for, as well as a front end component that we could interact with, which we used PHP/HTML/CSS for. This was the first project where we had to use these languages and it was fun to learn and create.

The template came from https://blog.codepen.io/2018/02/16/need-make-tournament-bracket/

To run the code (on a Mac):
1. Have all php files in the htdocs folder
2. Fire up MAMP and start servers. This will launch the MAMP homepage
3. Clone repo and navigate to http://localhost:8888/ncaa-march-madness/index.php
